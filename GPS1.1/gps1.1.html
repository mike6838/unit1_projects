        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Peer pairing is a system of computer programming where two developers
        work side-by-side on one project. Within the driver/navigator style, one 
        developer plays the role as the scribe, typing what the navigator has directed.</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h4>
        <p>Pairing was a lot of fun. I’m not a huge fan of doing it over the internet and would have liked to sit next to my partner. At first we we’re having some technical difficulties related to lag and then my partner’s mic began to sound like a robot. This was sort of annoying, but I didn't let it affect out work. Our communication was working well for us, and in the future, I want to do more on my end to increase my communication.</p>
