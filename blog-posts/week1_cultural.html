				<p>The impression I got from the video on the DBC experience is that students need to come to DBC ready to take control of their learning. It won’t be enough to go through the phases like another class in college. It’s going to be incredibly difficult, but being honest with yourself and your fellow students and teachers will be a key part in succeeding in DBC.</p>
				<p>I see myself making a substantial effort in helping people and understanding the problems of others in order form a solution. Being empathetic to others is incredibly important to me and I also gain a lot from working through problems with people. I like to be supportive of people and their ideas and thoughts.</p>
				<p>My expectations of DBC have changed. I will admit that I was approaching DBC as a customer waiting for their food at a restaurant; going through the motions and not looking for areas to go above and beyond. That has now changed. I need to take charge of my experience; I need to be honest in what it’s going to take.</p>
				<p>I am excited to participate in this kind of no bullshit-learning environment. I want to be a web developer and I want to see my peers succeed. </p>
				<p>I’m not sure if I’m nervous or not; sometimes I begin to feel as if cloud of negativity is about to come over me, but I do my best to remain mindful of what’s around me and what I need to focus on. The future is unpredictable and what I do now is all that I can control. I need to place my energy on progressing, instead of feeling worried about potential hypotheticals that might never to be.</p>
