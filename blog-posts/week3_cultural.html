				<h3>Growth Mindset & Self-Empathy </h3>
				<p>My experience up until his point of Phase 0 has been a struggle. I originally began learning Rails on my own and I hit a wall in what I could achieve on my own. I didn’t know how I could go about learning and I needed a guide. I began researching programs and eventually decided on DBC. My only application was to DBC and fortunately for me, I was accepted. As I began Phase 0, I realized that I was thrown back into learning by myself; although the major difference this time was at least it was guided week by week.</p>
				<p>I’ve been struggling with the exercises in Phase 0 because of my abstract random thinking style. Since I tend to learn better in an environment with people interacting with one another to solve a problem, I feel as if I’m missing out on a higher level of learning if I were to cater to my thinking style. Fortunately, as we are moving along in Phase 0, I’ve been getting to know other people in my accountability group and cohort. This is helpful for me because some of my peers learn in similar ways to me, and are very happy and willing to work on some of the exercises over Google Hangout. Being able to talk to people and bounce ideas and questions off them has really helped to solidify my learning so far in Phase 0.  </p>
				<p>As Phase 0 continues and as I meet more people in my cohort, I’m going to reach out to more of my peers to work on exercises with them. I’m also going to make an attempt to be more available to people who post on the Google+ board looking for pairing sessions, even if I have already done the exercise. Since I do learn better interacting with other people, I think it will further solidify my learning of the material me to pair with another person, even after I’ve completed the exercise by myself. </p>
				<p>Although I have not read Dweck’s Mindset: The New Psychology of Success, the summaries I’ve read did not mention the idea of self-empathy as a way to increase your ability to learn. The Growth Mindset formula recommends to individuals to “embrace challenges” and to “persist in the face of setbacks.” I think these are great recommendations, but for each piece of advice, one question needs to be answered: “how?” </p>
				<p>After 12+ years of formal schooling, the idea of embracing challenges or persisting in the face of setbacks seems a bit far-fetched or perhaps too existential. Children are often told so-and-so is good at math and another student is bad at math. Children are often left with the impression that some people are just born being good at something, and others are not. Experiences like these are experiences that many of us can relate to, and unfortunately leads to the introduction of a fixed mindset worldview at a very young age. </p>
				<p>This brings me back to the question of how do we achieve a growth mindset worldview. I believe that self-empathy will assist in achieving the goal of having a growth mindset because it will give you tools to cope with the curiosities, challenges, criticisms, failures, and disappointment that is to be expected in any of life’s new beginnings. </p>
