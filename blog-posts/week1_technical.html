				<h3>Gmail</h3>
				<p>Gmail is one of my favorite websites because it’s very easy to consume and also be productive. I can find what I’m looking for efficiently and whenever I run into a problem I feel as if I have a good idea where I need to go to find a solution. While looking at the homepage while signed in, my eye is drawn to the top email on the list. When I step back further my eye is drawn to the actual list of emails. I’d say that it is the most important part of the website. Five adjectives I’d use to describe the visual aspect of gmail are: simple, function, bland, unpretentious, and uncreative. Gmail solves the problem of having an email client because they’ve successfully built an email web application that is much better than any client I have used. Five adjectives I’d use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site are: practical, individual, straightforward, easy, and forefront. These adjectives are similar to the ones when describing the visual aspects of gmail. It’s very easy to find what I need from the home page and just about any other page. Gmail’s search feature is very good; I have many options to filter the search results to find exactly what I want. After spending a lot of time, I tend to feel indifferent about my experience. I speculate that this is because when I am on gmail, it is very purposeful. Other than ads, gmail does not sell anything and I don’t find much use for the ads.</p>
				<h3>BBC</h3>
				<p>BBC is one of my favorite websites because it’s incredibly consistent and I don’t have to spend much time to get caught up with current events. I also enjoy the range of subjects they report on. Upon loading the homepage, my eyes are immediately drawn to the main headline. When I stand back further, my eyes are drawn to the photo associated with the main headline. As for me, the headline and picture associated with it are not the most important part of the website. Five adjectives to describe the website visually are: clear, rigid, flat, organized, easy. BBC attempts to solve the problem of consuming news and media online. Five adjectives I’d use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of BBC are: practical, superfluous, consumable, clickable, and readable. These adjectives are much different than the adjectives I used to describe BBC visually. When I go to BBC, I am never looking for anything in particular. From the homepage, I move on to another page because I see a headline that interests me; otherwise, I don’t have a set story I’m after. Furthermore, after I have clicked on a page, since I’m not necessarily looking for anything other than something that interest me, I tend to go back to the homepage to find another story. BBC has a lot of content and it is actually quite difficult to browse through all of it. I feel bored after being on the site for a while because I feel that I’ve come to the end of the road with respect to media to consume, at the media I’m interested in. BBC probably sells something somewhere on the their website, but as far as I know, they don’t.</p>
				<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
				<p>Wikipedia is one of my favorite websites because of the ease of finding trivial information. The homepage is actually my least favorite part of Wikipedia and also the least visited part of the website. When looking at the homepage, the picture of a puzzled globe is the first thing I see. Standing back, I see that there are many different languages surrounding the puzzled globe. This is not the most important part of the homepage; I’d say the search bar is the most important part of the homepage. Five adjectives I’d use to describe Wikipedia are: simple, fluid, easy, flat, and clean. Wikipedia attempts to solve the problem of dispersed information on a wide range of topics. The user-generated content includes information on a wide range of subjects. Five adjectives I would you to describe the content, focus, and purpose of Wikipedia are: readable, consumable, universal, editable, and organized. These adjectives are fairly similar to the adjectives I used to describe the visual aspect of the site. It’s not very easy to find what you’re looking for from the homepage or another page. It’s much easier to type in Google what you’re looking for exactly, and click through the link to the webpage on Wikipedia. Browsing through the content of the site (a particular webpage on a particular topic) is very easy. I really enjoy the fluidness of being able to scroll down and seeing each section on a particular topic. I’m never on Wikipedia for a very long time. It’s not a website to get in depth information on a particular subject. I use it for trivial information on something and then I click out of it on my browser. I find what I need quickly and move on. As far as I know, Wikipedia does not sell anything. </p>
